- Added *Restart & Run All* to the *Kernel* menu. Users can also bind it to a keyboard shortcut on action ``restart-kernel-and-run-all-cells``.
- Added multiple-cell selection. Users press ``Shift-Up/Down`` or ``Shift-K/J`` to extend selection in command mode. Various actions such as cut/copy/paste, execute, and cell type conversions apply to all selected cells.

  .. image:: /_static/images/multi-select-41.png

- Added a command palette for executing Jupyter actions by name. Users press ``Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P`` or click the new command palette icon on the toolbar.

- Added a *Find and Replace* dialog to the *Edit* menu. Users can also press ``F`` in command mode to show the dialog.

Other improvements:

- Custom KernelManager methods can be Tornado coroutines, allowing async operations.
- Make clearing output optional when rewriting input with ``set_next_input(replace=True)``.
- Added support for TLS client authentication via ``--NotebookApp.client-ca``.
- Added tags to ``jupyter/notebook`` releases on DockerHub. ``latest`` continues to track the master branch.
