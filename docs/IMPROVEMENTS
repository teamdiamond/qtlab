Below we list a number of possible improvements to the QTLab codebase.

They will probably not all be done (depending on time and priorities) but we
will still collect ideas & suggestions here.

=========================================================

- Properly document the design of QTLab, e.g.

  - the interplay of QTLab with GTK (GObject) and IPython.
  - proper usage of the main QTLab classes.

- Get rid, as much as possible, of the 'execfile' pattern that
  is sprinkled throughout the code. Use proper modules instead.

- Document (and possibly remove) cruft.

- Improve and document the installation procedure.

- Remove dependency on 32-bit version of Python, if possible.

- Remove dependency on the old version of IPython.

- Remove dependency on IPython alltogether.

- Remove the soft dependency on Console2.

- Remove dependency on GTK / GObject for event handling.

  (This will be tricky!)

- Check if we need the VISA dependency.

- Remove dependency on specific Python distribution.

  (We now depend on the Enthought Canopy distribution, in particular the
   Python 2, old version 1.x.y version. This is undesirable. It would
   be much referable if we could also get it to work on a different
   distribution, e.g. Anaconda.

- Switch from Python 2 to Python 3.

- Bring the code more in line with PEP-8 conventions.

- Improve overall code quality:

  - consistent whitespace
  - add source documentation
  - just in general, implement stuff better.
