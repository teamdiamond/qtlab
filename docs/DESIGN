(Just a few short notes for now; we will flesh this out to a proper document later on).

QTLab has a pretty hard dependency on IPython and GTK. the reason is that it implements the
desirable combination of an interactive console with 'background tasks' that run even when
the interactive console is waiting for input. The chosen implementation has the added advantage
of essentially running in a single thread.

How it works
============

IPython is started with the '--gui=gtk' option. This ensures that the IPython interactive console
will call GTK's event processing code whenever it is idly waiting for input.

This means that timed GTK events will be executed more-or-less nicely, if the QTLab console is idle.

However, once a measurement is started, the idle hook will no longer be called, which poses a problem.
To handle this, all measurement scripts must make use of the mstart(), msleep() and mend() function
calls. The msleep() function in particular is implemented in such a way that it will callinto GTK
to allow it to process its events and timers.
